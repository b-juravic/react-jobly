## Jobly - The Front End

<em>An online job board project complete with authentication and search functionality</em>

Jobly is a mobile frist responsive single page React application that will be using a progressive enhancement approach for cross-browser compatability (using flexbox when supported). The flexbox updates are a work in progress, but the navigation component updates are complete and can be viewed at this time.

* Once a user has registered and/or logged in, they gain access to the private routes only accessible by authenticating and theyâ€™re greeted with a personalized welcome message when on the home page.
* Users have the ability to browse all jobs and all companies, as well as search jobs by title and search companies by name.
* Users can also apply to jobs and edit information in their user profile.
* View Jobly back end source code [here](https://github.com/b-juravic/jobly-backend-express)
