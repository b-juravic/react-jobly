## Jobly - The Front End

Jobly is an online job board project, built as a single page React application, complete with authentication and search functionality.
* Once a user has registered and/or logged in, they gain access to the private routes only accessible by authenticating and theyâ€™re greeted with a personalized welcome message when on the home page.
* Users have the ability to browse all jobs and all companies, as well as search jobs by title and search companies by name.
* Users can also apply to jobs and edit information in their user profile.
* View Jobly back end source code [here](https://github.com/b-juravic/jobly-backend-express)
